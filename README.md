Our project is creating a Sudoku web browser game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We will adapting the source code to include a timer that will take the time the user spends in completing a sudoku board and display it when they are done. We will also be changing the user input from just numbers to include images for each number. This is all to create a more exciting and engineering centered game of Sudoku.

Simply download all of the files together and open the HTML file in a browser such as Google Chrome. Then you can get to playing.
